## How to use it

"Class" and "method" are used to indicate in which method and class the unit test is made.
To have an ArrayList as a result, you must check the "ArrayList" box and choose the type of the ArrayList in "Contains".

For the parameters, you can have one or two, the left column is for the first, the right column for the second.
Each possibility is put in one of the fields.
The three buttons only predefine the fields, you can customize them.

To have an ArrayList parameter, you must check the "ArrayList" box of the parameter. The last possibility of the parameter will change to "Contains" and it will be necessary to put here the type of the parameter.

The tests are generated by pressing "Generate". A window will display to enter the result of each possibility, the first parameter will be to the left and the second to the right, it will be necessary to enter the result. The generated unit tests will be displayed on the right, just paste them into the test class.

### Special values

To enter strings, you must simply put them in quotation marks.

To enter ArrayLists, you must check the box for the parameter/results and put the type of the ArrayList in "Contains". In the possiblities, you must put the values in square brackets separated by commas.
